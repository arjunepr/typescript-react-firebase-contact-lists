## React + Firebase Contact Lists

Originally intended as an Electron desktop app with SQLite as data store.

Now, it's a firebase app with neDB as the local data store. 

However, take note that I've only used the hosting feature provided by firebase.

Makes use of react and typescript.

You can access the app [here](https://react-contact-list-32639.firebaseapp.com/)

I've made use of [webpack-wannabe-boilerplate](https://github.com/arjunepr/webpack-wannabe-template) which I am the author of.
