## React + Firebase Contact Lists

Originally intended as an Electron desktop app with SQLite as data store.

Now, it's a firebase app with neDB as the local data store. 

You can access the app [here](https://react-contact-list-32639.firebaseapp.com/)

I've made use of [webpack-wannabe-boilerplate](https://github.com/arjunepr/webpack-wannabe-template) which I am the author of.
